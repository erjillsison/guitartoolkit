NOTES = C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C

MAJOR SCALE = 1 3 5 6 8 10 12

MAJOR SCALE -1 as index
0 2 4 5 7 9 11

loop through MAJOR SCALE in NOTES to get

for each x in MAJOR SCALE
	C MAJOR.add(notes.get(x))	

C major = C D E F G A B



if starts at D which is index 2

to find the notes, MAJOR SCALEinterval +2
3 5 7 8 10 12 14

-1 to use as list index

2 4 6 7 9 11 13

get notes from NOTES list using above index, if 12 or more, subtract 12 to loop back to 0 index
